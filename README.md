# Stencil Boilerplate

App boilerplate for [Stencil](https://stenciljs.com/) applications.

It features a couple of common principles and workflows that are used at the moment in the Web Apps development world:
   * Routing using [Stencil Router](https://github.com/ionic-team/stencil-router)
   * Redux:
      * [Stencil Redux](https://github.com/ionic-team/stencil-redux) is used as basic router
      * Connected router (like [react-router-redux](https://github.com/ReactTraining/react-router/tree/master/packages/react-router-redux)) component
      * Typed actions (as described in [this article](https://medium.com/@martin_hotell/redux-typescript-typed-actions-with-less-keystrokes-d984063901d)) pattern for a better typed-coding experience 
      * Browser extension (using [Redux DevTools Extension](https://github.com/zalmoxisus/redux-devtools-extension)) included for easier development
   * Automated testing - [Jest](https://facebook.github.io/jest/)
   * Linting:
      * [TSLint](https://palantir.github.io/tslint/)
      * [stylelint](https://stylelint.io/) 
      * Manually-configured rules
   * Fully-configured for development using [JetBrains](https://www.jetbrains.com/) products:
      * Code Styles
      * Run Configurations
   * Decorators for quicker development:
      * Debounce
      * Autobind
   * Translations system
      * Connected to Redux - map the translations directly as a prop
      * Named values replacement
      * Component for quicker translations
   * Advanced CSS tehniques:
      * SCSS pre-processor
      * Grid layout
      * Centralized variables
      * Material-UI-based styles
   * nginx configuration 

Please note that this boilerplate is built for web apps rather than public websites. This means that stuff like **prerendering** and **server side rendering** are not enabled and the styles are specifically built for [WebKit](https://webkit.org/)-based browsers.

## Known Issues
* Automated Testing is not working
